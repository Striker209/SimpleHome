SimpleHome is my first plugin made for PocketMine. It's fun to learn PocketMine API, and to use Github and PhpStorm.

I might stop SimpleHome development after finishing, but I do have planned features if I'd like to continue. I'm planning more plugins to come after SimpleHome. Maybe a suite of PocketMine plugins like Bukkit's Essentials but in individual plugins so people can choose which features they want.


## Installation
1. Download the latest plugin release from [Github](https://github.com/dutok/SimpleHome/releases) or [PocketMine] (http://pocketmine.net). Github typically has the latest releases.
2. Drop the SimpleHome.phar into PocketMine-MP\plugins
3. Restart or reload the server.
